# RNN Model with PyTorch

This repository contains the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using PyTorch. RNNs are commonly used for processing sequential data such as text, time-series, and speech. This project is designed to showcase the implementation and training of an RNN for sequence data modeling.

## Project Overview

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks well-suited to processing sequential data due to their internal memory. RNNs maintain a hidden state that captures information about previous elements in the sequence, allowing them to make informed predictions. This notebook demonstrates how to build and train an RNN using PyTorch.

### Key Features:

- **Custom RNN Architecture**: The notebook implements a simple RNN from scratch using PyTorch’s `torch.nn` module.
- **Training on Sequential Data**: The notebook demonstrates training the RNN on sequential data using backpropagation through time (BPTT).
- **Handling of Variable-Length Sequences**: The RNN is capable of processing sequences of varying lengths, a common feature in time-series or natural language processing tasks.
- **Visualization**: The notebook includes visualizations of training loss, accuracy, and other metrics to monitor the model’s performance.

## Dataset

The project uses a simple sequence dataset (e.g., character-level text data or a sequence classification task). The dataset can be easily replaced with any other sequence data, such as time-series data, stock prices, or sequential sensor data.

The dataset used in this notebook can be customized based on the task at hand. Popular datasets include:
- Text-based datasets for character-level or word-level prediction.
- Time-series datasets for forecasting tasks.
- Name-based datasets (e.g., Name dataset from PyTorch libraries).

## Model Architecture

The implemented RNN model includes:
- **Input Layer**: Processes the input sequence.
- **Hidden Layers**: Recurrent hidden layers that maintain the hidden state across the time steps.
- **Output Layer**: Maps the hidden state to the output space (e.g., prediction of the next character, word, or class).

### Key Components:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts the input sequence into dense vectors of fixed size.
- **Recurrent Layer**: The core of the RNN, which maintains the hidden state and processes each element in the sequence.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: Converts the final hidden state into the desired output.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AqaPayam/RNN_Model_PyTorch.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    You need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
    - PyTorch
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib
    - Torchvision (optional for certain datasets)

    Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install torch numpy matplotlib
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Launch the Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook RNN_Model.ipynb
    ```

## Running the Model

### Training the RNN

The training process involves feeding sequential data into the RNN and using backpropagation through time (BPTT) to optimize the model weights.

- **Input**: Sequences of data (e.g., characters in a text or points in time-series).
- **Training Loop**: The notebook includes a loop for training the model over multiple epochs, adjusting the weights based on the loss function.
- **Optimization**: The model is optimized using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer or any other suitable optimizer available in PyTorch.

### Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset (if available) to assess its performance. The notebook includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, loss curves, and visualizations of the predictions compared to the ground truth.

## Example Usage

The RNN can be applied to a variety of sequential data tasks, including:
- **Character-Level Language Modeling**: Predict the next character in a sequence of text.
- **Time-Series Prediction**: Forecast future values in a sequence of temporal data.
- **Sequence Classification**: Classify entire sequences, such as identifying the language of a text based on its characters.

## Visualization

The notebook includes visualizations of the training process, including:
- **Loss Curves**: Visualizing the training loss over time to monitor convergence.
- **Accuracy Curves**: Plotting accuracy during training to observe improvements.

## Customization

The notebook can be easily adapted to different tasks and datasets:
- **Changing the Dataset**: Replace the sequence dataset with your own dataset.
- **Modifying the Model**: Adjust the architecture by adding more layers, using different types of RNNs (LSTM, GRU), or changing hyperparameters.
- **Experimentation**: Test the model on various sequence prediction tasks, modify the learning rate, optimizer, and other training parameters.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundation for exploring Recurrent Neural Networks and their application to sequential data. By using PyTorch, the implementation is flexible and can be extended to more complex RNN-based tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, and video analysis.
